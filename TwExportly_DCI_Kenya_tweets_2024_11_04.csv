On Friday, November 1, 2024, around 4:40 PM, an individual armed with a hammer managed to enter Ushirika Tower in Eastleigh. After gaining entry, he proceeded to an apartment on the sixth floor with the assistance of a house-help named Everlyne, who is a Ugandan national.

Upon entering, the assailant, reportedly a Ugandan national, grievously assaulted a 20-year-old Somali house-help named Hakimo Muhidin with assistance from Evelyne. 

During the incident, various valuable items were pilfered, including pieces of gold jewellery, an unspecified amount of cash in both KES and U.S. dollars, as well as four laptops belonging to the family, which were reported stolen during the incident. 
Hakimo Muhidin sustained serious injuries, including a broken tooth and injuries to her hand, head, and legs. Additionally, she exhibited signs of having been whipped, with visible marks on her back. 

After receiving medical treatment, she has been discharged and is currently recovering at a relative's home in the Tassia estate area. 

Evelyne, who had joined the household three weeks prior to the incident, managed to escape alongside the assailant.

Following the pursuit and subsequent gunning down of murder suspect initially identified as George Oduor Okoth, and from whom two firearms were recovered (one belonging to the late Willis Ayieko), detectives handling the homicide have established his true identity and roots, finally uncovering the man so wanted in numerous violent robberies in the region.

The discovery of ""Oduor's"" home which is at Rai area of Nyamasaria in Kisumu County followed identification of his body (preserved at JOOTRH mortuary) by his father, who further clarified that his son's real name was Robert Wakolo Okoth, and his alias names George Oduor Okoth and Kim (based on who asked) were only used to cover his criminal trail and escape police dragnets. Indeed, a national ID card retrieved from police exhibit store for wanted criminals earlier seized during a security operation, and a report obtained from the National Registration Bureau (NRB) confirmed the father's claim.

Armed with the discovery, the DCI Crime Research and Intelligence Bureau detectives who had been profiling an unidentified robbery suspect, linked the 34-year-old to a series of violent attacks, including the January 27, 2024 fatal shooting of Ms Grace Awino Odero, who was an Mpesa attendant at Kibuye market near Hekima School in Lolwe. In the incident, one suspect was arrested, and an AK 47 rifle earlier robbed from a Ugandan police officer recovered. Also recovered was a Toyota Axio Reg. No. KDL 301P used by the suspects in the robbery. Robert Wakolo, however, managed to get away.

In yet another incident on 3rd May, 2024, detectives working on intelligence leads had raided Robert's home in Nyamasaria, recovering another AK 47 rifle, a magazine and 36 live rounds of ammunition. Although Robert slipped away, again, his 17-year-old younger brother and suspected accomplice was arrested and charged.

Robert Wakolo was also wanted by Kondele police for robbery with violence and possessing a magazine and ammunitions.",en,Tweet,35,285,70,109,173103,2024-11-03 14:33:48,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/android"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for Android</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gbdd2IIaEAAQcfJ.jpg

Stephen Oloichoki alias Musa Sopia, the prime suspect in a series of violent robberies and murders within Narok township has been arrested, again, following months of scrupulous manhunt by Narok-based detectives.

The suspect, who is a jailbird and has been in prison confines for 15 years until his release on March 2024, was cornered and arrested while in possession of his weapons of choice; a dagger, a sword and a Maasai rungu.

In the incidents that rocked the area days following his release, a hooded lone thug was reported to be accosting business operators in the town, before striking them down with a blunt object and disappearing with their valuables. Sadly, most victims succumbed to the head hits.

But by the stroke of luck, one of the suspect's criminal activities was captured by a CCTV camera as he attempted to break into a shop. He aborted the mission on spotting the cameras, but not without blessing his night with several crates of bread delivered to the next shop. The footage was circulated among security agents.

On Monday, October 28 at around midnight, a report was made that a person had been struck dead at Ololulunga area in Narok South. Coincidentally, it was at the same location where the cctv footage had been obtained.

A security operation was swiftly launched which saw Oloichoki arrested. He was in the same clothes worn in the cctv footage.  (His race was no longer amazing).

The suspect has since confessed to several attacks and showed investigators places where he sold the valuables stolen from his victims, leading to the arrest of three more suspects namely; Timothy Manyara, Samuel Kibutu Ngongo and John Ndung'u Wanjiru.

It has also been established that Oloichoki had been handed a life sentence for a violent robbery by the Narok court in 2009, only to be released 15 years later in March this year after an appeal. Even so, his previous life in crime quickly caught up with him.

Under investigations are six deaths in which Oloichoki is implicated, all committed between April and October, 2024. Appropriate charges including robbery with violence have been preferred against him at Narok Law Courts.",en,Tweet,10,142,25,81,38707,2024-10-31 15:43:59,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/android"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for Android</a>",,,photo,"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GbORGr0XgAAcMr2.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GbORG_0WUAEZgbM.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GbORHZLWUAAojr5.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/ext_tw_video_thumb/1851983413613305856/pu/img/jHtYVLNnzXHsqnHX.jpg"

Police in Siaya, Gem Wagai sub-county, today recovered a pistol belonging to the late Wells Fargo Human Resource Manager, Mr. Willis Ayieko. This firearm had been robbed from him on the night he was murdered.

The recovery was made following a tip-off from members of the public, reporting that two individuals—one male and one female—were seen with a gun in a Toyota Axio, registration number KDN 948B, at Wagai Trading Centre.

Responding, officers from Wagai Police Station flagged down the suspect’s vehicle, but the male driver defied the orders and instead opened fire on the police while speeding off towards Luanda.

This prompted a hot chase that ended at Adder Farm within Kagilo area, where the vehicle lost control and rolled over on the left side of the road. 
Unfortunately, the driver managed to escape, leaving behind the female passenger, who was injured and unconscious.

After an intense manhunt spanning several weeks, detectives from Kasarani Sub-County have apprehended two suspects for their involvement in the brutal murder of 26-year-old Mercy Rufani.

The suspects, Joseph Ngera Kamau and Fred Mathenge Kanja, both Kenya Army officers based in Embakasi, were the last known individuals to have been in contact with Mercy. They have been arrested after her body was discovered dumped in Mwiki area along the Eastern Bypass.

Investigations revealed that Mercy was reported missing from her parents’ home in Pipeline, Embakasi, on September 28, 2024. The search for her turned into a heart-wrenching saga, culminating in the discovery of her lifeless body, partially undressed and bearing bruises on her thighs, lower back, and left ankle. Beside her, detectives found a black blouse, a blanket, and a mobile phone.

It was further established that on that fateful night, Joseph Ngera picked up Mercy from her home in a motor vehicle Reg. No. Mazda, KDA 796L, and proceeded to his house in Komarock. While at the parking lot, a misunderstanding ensued, leading to a confrontation in which Kamau assaulted Mercy, resulting in her death. Kamau then called his accomplice, Kanja, to help him dispose of the body.

Following forensic trails, detectives flushed Kamau and Kanja out of their hideouts in Komarock Estate and Tononoka area in Embakasi, respectively.

Detectives drawn from DCI Nairobi Regional Headquarters have achieved a significant breakthrough in the fight against fraud with the apprehension of Brian Reeves Obare who is implicated in a scheme that siphoned millions of shillings from the pockets of unsuspecting Kenyans

Obare's arrest took place in Ongata Rongai town, a culmination of efforts sparked by a formal complaint lodged by one of his victims  on August 19, 2024. The investigation gained momentum following a further detailed report captured in another letter dated October 8, 2024. According to the allegations, Obare colluded with accomplices to lure victims with false promises of employment opportunities in Canada, assuring them of assistance with necessary documentation. Tragically, these assurances were nothing more than empty words, leaving many individuals in severe financial hardships.

Detectives domiciled at DCI Mbeere South have brought Benson David Mwendwa, a murder suspect before the Embu High Court to face justice.

Mwendwa is accused of orchestrating the gruesome murder of Jane Kilonzi, 44, on September 25, 2024. Her lifeless body was found in a pool of water in Kiambere division of Mbeere South Sub-County, Embu County, bearing severe bruises and with blood streaming from her mouth and nose.

A meticulous investigation by detectives revealed that Kilonzi, a widow, had been living on a farm where her late husband worked as a supervisor. After the death of the husband in late 2023, Mwendwa was employed as the farm supervisor and was housed in one of Kilonzi’s son’s house. Though he left the job after three months, he continued to stay in the house.

During his stay, a relationship blossomed between Mwendwa and Kilonzi, much to the dismay of her son. This disapproval by the son led to Mwendwa’s eviction from the house, forcing him to find accommodation in Isakho area.

On September 25, 2024, Mwendwa returned to the homestead and shared supper with Kilonzi. After supper, he insisted on spending the night in Kilonzi’s house where she refused, suggesting he sleep in her son’s house as before. A heated argument ensued, culminating in Mwendwa striking Kilonzi on the head, knocking her unconscious. He then dragged her to the nearby Ciakarigu River, where he continued his brutal assault before leaving her for dead and watching over her all night.

After an intense manhunt, spanning several weeks, Mwendwa was finally apprehended and arraigned before the Embu High Court where he pleaded not guilty to the charges. 

The suspect is being detained at Majimbo Prison as the case is scheduled for pre-trials on November 19, 2024.",en,Tweet,2,76,10,33,28060,2024-10-16 16:33:35,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GaBMi-vXYAAjn-Y.jpg

Moses Kabali, a Ugandan national, has been sentenced to five years in prison by the Kahawa Chief Magistrate Court. Kabali faced hoaxing charges under Section 26 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act No. 30 of 2012.

Before arraignment, it was established that on June 30, 2024, Kabali emailed the Interpol General Secretariat in France, requesting them to inform Kenyan security agencies, specifically the Anti-Terrorism Police Unit (ATPU), of an imminent terrorist attack by a known terrorist group. He further alleged that two individuals known to him working with other unknown terror operatives were planning to carry out an imminent terror attack in Kenya by use of Improvised Explosive Devices.

The ATPU detectives launched investigations where they arrested a female suspect whose phone number was mentioned in Kabali’s report. Upon questioning, she disclosed that the said phone number had been registered using her ID card but was being used by her cousin. A manhunt for the said cousin ensued, and she was arrested in Eastleigh, Jam Street, on August 31, 2024. However, further investigations revealed that she had no links to any terrorist group and was unaware of any planned attack.

To unravel the mystery, Moses Kabali was arrested on September 3, 2024, at the California Group of Schools in Eastleigh. A search of his residence led to the seizure of two mobile phones, two laptops, and various documents. Forensic analysis at the Anti-Terrorism Forensic Laboratory revealed that Kabali was the author of the said email as the same was found to have originated from his yahoo mail account.

It was further established that Kabali authored and sent the malicious email to the Interpol General Secretariat in France acting out of anger to punish his wife whom they had separated.

Kabali was arraigned to face the charges and the matter came up for sentencing before Hon. Gideon Kiage where the accused was sentenced to a fine of Sh5,000,000 and in default to serve a term of 5 years imprisonment.",en,Tweet,12,159,22,48,48308,2024-10-15 10:02:37,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,photo,"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GZ6phWVXoAAxLlh.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GZ6pjuGWoAALLGf.jpg"

'1844320466556645476',"DCI JOINS THE NATION IN MAZINGIRA DAY CELBRATIONS BY PLANTING 3000, TREES.

In a significant step towards environmental conservation, the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) actively participated in the national Mazingira Day celebrations by planting 3,000 trees. This initiative aligns with the recent legislative changes where Utamaduni Day was substituted with Mazingira Day through the Miscellaneous Amendment Act 2024, amending the Public Holidays Act (Cap.110). Henceforth, Mazingira Day will be celebrated annually on October 10, marking a pivotal shift towards prioritizing environmental preservation within Kenya.

The commemoration of Mazingira Day by the DCI was led by the Deputy Director of Criminal Investigations, Mr. John Onyango. The tree planting exercise saw participation from various directorates within the DCI, taking place at the headquarters of the agency. This move underscores the DCI's commitment to not only uphold law and order but also to play a crucial role in environmental conservation.

The initiative is in direct response to President William Ruto's directive to plant 15 billion trees by 2032, a monumental goal aimed at combating climate change and enhancing the country's green cover. The DCI has shown commendable progress towards this target, with a total of 14,000 trees planted in various locations to date. These include 3,000 trees at the DCI headquarters, another 3,000 trees at the National Criminal Intelligence Academy (NCIA), 5,000 trees at the National Police Service GSU Field Training Camp in Magadi, and an additional 3,000 trees planted on Mazingira Day itself.

Mr. Onyango emphasized the DCI's intention to extend its collaborative efforts with schools, hospitals, and other institutions for tree planting. This approach is geared towards overcoming space limitations and ensuring the broad reach and impact of this green initiative. He also praised the dedication of DCI officers and staff, who have shown overwhelming support for the cause.

To ensure the sustainability of this initiative, the newly appointed head of Reforms, Research, and Innovation Development (RRID), Dr. Phillip Ouma, Phd has been tasked with overseeing the maintenance and growth of the newly planted trees. Mr. Onyango highlighted the importance of not just planting trees, but also nurturing them to maturity, to fully realize their environmental benefits.

The Mazingira Day celebrations saw the participation of directors from different DCI directorates and civilian staff, all coming together to mark this important day. The event not only signifies the DCI's environmental stewardship but also sets a precedent for other government agencies and the private sector to follow suit in contributing to the country's reforestation efforts.

As Kenya celebrates Mazingira Day, the DCI's proactive participation in this national initiative showcases its dedication to safeguarding the environment for future generations. It's a reminder that every effort counts in the fight against climate change and environmental degradation, and collective action can lead to significant positive impacts.

On September 30th, 2024, former Kiambu County Governor Ferdinand Waititu was arrested and put behind bars pending arraignment for offensive conduct, in violation of Section 94(1) of the Penal Code.

His arrest came in response to a report by a concerned citizen, who confided through the DCI’s toll-free FICHUA KWA DCI number 0800 722 203.

The report drew attention to a video circulating on social media, in which Hon. Waititu, speaking at a public rally held in Ruiru Stadium, allegedly made inflammatory and abusive remarks likely to provoke a breach of peace.

The video, believed to have been recorded on September 29th, 2024, was posted on TikTok by the account @kikuyunationtv. Upon receiving the tip, the DCI’s Cyber Crime Unit was immediately deployed to investigate the matter. Detectives thoroughly examined the footage, which captured Waititu speaking in Kikuyu, a vernacular language.

In collaboration with Communications Authority of Kenya (CA), Investigators retrieved the raw footage from its publisher, @kikuyunationtv. The footage was further certified and a comprehensive translation of the speech from Kikuyu to English was later conducted by an expert to ensure accuracy. 

Following an in-depth analysis, it was established that the former governor’s remarks indeed constituted offensive conduct.

With the evidence firmly established, the investigative team recommended that Hon. Ferdinand Waititu be formally charged under Section 94(1) of the Penal Code for his offensive conduct.

Coordinated efforts between detectives, traffic, and general duties officers from Voi Police Station saw the arrest of a trafficker who attempted to slip through officer’s fingers, seizing Bhang worth over Sh7 million in the streets.

When traffic officers near Izera Ranch signalled him to stop, Angwech, in a foolhardy move, floored the accelerator and bolted towards Mombasa. This reckless dash triggered an immediate response from the DCI and general duty officers, who sprang into action without missing a beat, setting off a high-octane chase.

After a heart-pounding pursuit, the vehicle was finally intercepted off-road. Under the watchful eyes of the officers, it was escorted back to Voi Police Station.

'1841846630129037792',"SHAKAHOLA CASE HEARING

In the depths of Shakahola forest, dubbed ‘Jangwani,’ lay sections with Biblical names like Bethlehem, Capernaum, Samaria, Galilee, and Judah. Galilee, the abode of Mackenzie, became a sinister sanctuary. A minor under witness protection recounted how parents were commanded to starve their children, promising them a celestial meeting with Christ in Heaven.

On the fourth day of this week’s hearing, the witness painfully recounted how his mother, blinded by Mackenzie’s teachings, led him and his brother into the dreaded forest. She ensured they dropped out of primary school in Mshomoroni, Mombasa. In October 2020, armed with nothing but clothes and a few utensils, the mother and her two sons sneaked out while their father, a matatu driver in Mombasa, was away. They boarded a matatu from Mshomoroni to Malindi. At Mackenzie’s church, they were ushered into a lorry, with the final stop being Shakahola forest.

Soon after, forced fasting was introduced. Mackenzie claimed to have conversed with Jesus, who revealed that ‘the Son of God’ would no longer come to earth; instead, men would meet him in heaven through ‘fasting’ to death. The witness recounted the alarming deaths of children, especially those under six years. The tragic highlight was the passing of four siblings, all under ten years old.

The brothers, unimpressed by the ordeal, attempted to escape the hunger by fleeing from the highly guarded forest. However, fate intervened, and they were recaptured by Mackenzie’s operatives while waiting for a vehicle by the roadside. They were taken to Mackenzie’s home and ordered to be guarded until their mother’s return. They had no choice but to join the other children in fasting. Tragically, the witness’s 10-year-old brother succumbed to the fasting after a month.

The witness narrated how he was separated from his mother a few days later. Upon inquiring about her whereabouts, he was shocked to learn of her passing. Fortunately, police officers arrived just in time to rescue them, taking them through a delicate process of treatment and counselling.

As the listeners absorbed the shocking narration, a somber mood engulfed the courtroom. The next witness, a Muslim minor, recounted how he once fell ill at their home in Malindi. His mother and sister took him to Mackenzie’s Good News International Church for prayers. Feeling better after the prayers, their faith strengthened, and they decided to follow Mackenzie’s teachings, quoting Bible verses like Colossians 2:8 and 2:20. This led him and his sister to drop out of class 4 and 6 respectively and avoid hospital visits, enrolling in ‘Biblical study’ classes at Mackenzie’s church.

The witness narrated that they were rescued by law enforcement officers and later returned to school against his mother’s wishes, while his sister opted for early marriage. Despite this, their mother remained devoted to Mackenzie’s twisted teachings. In 2020, she sold household goods, claiming she was heading to their other home in Kakoneni. A year later, she returned, appearing feeble, revealing she had been in Shakahola and intended to return. Despite the witness’s pleas, she was unmoved and returned to Shakahola in February 2023. The witness never saw her again.

The session ended with an adjournment of the Prevention of Terrorism Act and Proceeds of Crime Act cases facing Mackenzie and his 92 co-accused persons until October 28, 2024.",en,Tweet,9,124,23,29,25591,2024-10-03 16:23:51,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,photo,"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GY-NpIqWgAEgapj.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GY-NrVJWoAAoe3_.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GY-NtU7WMAAk6RI.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GY-NurnWUAAA1Yb.jpg"

In a major breakthrough, a crack team of detectives from the DCI Headquarters Criminal Research and Intelligence Bureau (CRIB), Operation Support Unit (OSU), Operation Action Team (OAT) complimented by their counterparts drawn from Imenti Central and Buuri West Sub Counties have apprehended three notorious robbery with violence suspects and recovered an M16 rifle.

The individuals are believed to be the criminal masterminds behind a string of violent robberies in Imenti North and Buuri West Sub-Counties where they have reigned untold terror on the peace-loving locals. 

In one of their series of crimes reported on September 5th, 2024, the hoodlums brazenly stormed a homestead in Magati village, making off with two prized cows; a Friesian and an Ayrshire. During this audacious act, they fired five live rounds into the air, sending innocent villagers scampering for their safety. 

 In yet another chilling incident on September 15th, 2024, the suspects raided a home in Rugusu, stealing a dairy cow. They loaded the cow into a getaway pickup and vanished like phantoms. During this raid, the malefactors shot the owner, a woman, for raising  alarm. Tragically, she was pronounced dead on arrival at Kiirua Mission Hospital.

In their most recent bizarre escapade, the suspects attempted to torch a four-bedroom house, but the house did not catch fire. Frustrated by their failed arson attempt, they indiscriminately shot at the door of the house, hitting the man of the house three times in the belly and his wife in the abdomen. The victims are admitted at Kiirua mission hospital in serious condition.

With the precision of a hawk and the tenacity of a bloodhound, detectives tracked down the suspects, Patrick Muriera M’mbijiwe, 35, and Kenneth Muthethia Kiriinya alias Kiroria out of their hideouts. Through meticulous interrogation, the suspects eventually led the officers to Kianjuri village, where they claimed they had buried the firearm in a concealed location.

While at the site, the officers witnessed the dramatic retrieval of an M16 model (SAR) rifle, along with two magazines and 67 rounds of 5.5mm ammunition, a black jacket, two gunny bags, and a brown marvin, all concealed in a hole.

In an unfortunate turn of events, investigations revealed that a police officer based at Marsabit County namely Cpl Dominic Munene Peter has been working in cahoots with the thugs by facilitating their evil missions. He was swiftly arrested before holing up.

Remarkably, ballistic reports have conclusively linked the recovered firearm to earlier submitted cartridges, sealing the case like a jigsaw puzzle coming together.

'1841535589989917160',"SHAKAHOLA CASE HEARING UPDATE

In the hearing that resumed on Monday, September 30, a minor witness under the Witness Protection Agency painted a vivid picture for the Shanzu Chief Magistrate. He recounted how his family was drawn into Mackenzie’s web of teachings by his elder sister who introduced them to Mackenzie’s Times TV.

The witness, in his testimony that spilled over to the second day, described how his mother became so captivated by Mackenzie’s messages that she started attending the Good News International Ministry’s Nairobi branch. This led to the witness, then a primary school student in Nairobi County, being pulled out of school as the family prepared to relocate to the Shakahola forest.

In February 2022, the witness’s mother moved to Malindi to set the stage for their arrival, selling off their properties in Nairobi. Just two days later, she instructed the witness, his sister, and a 15-year-old cousin to join her in Malindi. They met at Mackenzie’s church, and the church quickly arranged transport to Shakahola forest. The four of them found themselves in a tuk-tuk, owned by one of Mackenzie’s followers, heading deep into the forest, about 80 kilometres from Malindi town.

In an unusual act of generosity, Mackenzie, through his operative in the forest, provided the family with land in Shakahola, where they built mud-walled houses with makuti-thatched roofs. By mid-2022, Mackenzie tightened his grip, declaring that forced fasting would begin, starting with the children, followed by the youth, women, men, and finally Mackenzie and his family.

The witness who has since resumed studies, recounted his rescue in March 2023 by the area chief and local village head. He was handed over to the Malindi Subcounty Children Officer and, due to severe malnutrition, taken to Malindi Subcounty Hospital and later to Mayungu Rescue Center for counselling. He shared his harrowing experience with law enforcement officers, noting that at the time of his rescue, his mother and sister were missing, while his cousin, now a prosecution witness, was also rescued in a severely malnourished state.

A second witness who is a minor under witness protection activated a jaw-dropping reaction in court on the second day, when he laid bare the fact that Pastor Mackenzie’s teachings were heavily influential on their family, to the extent that the all Muslim family joined the  Good News International Ministry Church.

The witness continued with his testimony into the third day of the hearing, disclosing to the court that before joining the pastor’s church, his father, who was a heavy swill-bowl started watching Mackenzie’s teachings on Times TV. Within no time, he had become a staunch follower of the preacher. He managed to convince the rest of his family to watch the preachings, with a subsequent request for them to join him in attending the Good News International Ministry Church in Makongeni, Nairobi.

Following Mackenzie’s unorthodox religious teachings, the witness’s father ordered him and his three siblings to stop schooling. They were pupils in one of the primary schools within Nairobi. According to the teachings, schooling was devilish. The witness’s mother who was a salonist also resigned due to the ‘devilish’ nature of braiding hair and applying makeup.

In April 2022, the witness accompanied his father to Shakahola forest where his father bought an acre of land from Mackenzie at Kshs. 3,000. The witness’s mother and his three siblings had escaped to their rural home a year earlier.

The witness narrated how when they were forced to fast, people would die in their numbers, and that their graves would be levelled, and vegetables planted on top to conceal their presence. He managed to escape in August 2022, where he was rescued by Malindi’s Children’s Officer and taken to Malindi Police Station, and later to a Children’s Centre. He added that he no longer knows the whereabouts of his father whom he left in the forest.

The hearing against Mackenzie and 92 others, charged with multiple counts under the Prevention of Terrorism Act and Prevention of Organized Crimes Act, continues tomorrow, October 3, 2024.",en,Tweet,6,87,20,25,19931,2024-10-02 19:47:53,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,photo,"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GY5ysE_XUAAH77v.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GY5yuOjWoAALwUA.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GY5yxKLXwAA9hI1.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GY5yz6QWgAAptA2.jpg"

In a significant breakthrough, two suspects, Mohammed Muhamud Abdi and Bashir Gabow, believed to be the owners of Mobilix Cargo and Supplies Ltd, have been arrested and charged in connection with a large-scale fraud case. The two allegedly defrauded over USD 250,000 from a group of business people in Nairobi’s Eastleigh back in 2018. The two had promised to assist the investors in importing clothing from China, but after receiving payment, they failed to honor their part of the bargain.

On August 13, 2018, the suspects acknowledged receiving a substantial sum from the group, but shortly after, they went silent. Despite multiple attempts by the victims to recover their funds, including written agreements on a refund process, the suspects made no effort to fulfill their end. For years, the victims were left without their hard-earned money, facing immense frustration.

After enduring years of back-and-forth, one brave member of the group, who had invested USD 100,000,  reached out to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) for help, sending a detailed letter on August 20, 2024, that described her ordeal. This move marked a turning point in the case.

Detectives from the DCI Nairobi Region Headquarters acted swiftly and within few days, the investigative team tracked down and arrested the two suspects on 27th August, 2024. The suspects were arraigned at Milimani Court and charged with obtaining money by false pretense thus bringing hope for justice to the defrauded investors.

Out of the eight victims involved, only one investor had the courage to come forward and report the fraud. We commend her bravery and courage as we remain committed to ensuring justice is served for all.

Detectives in Imenti North, Meru County have apprehended three 17-year-olds who orchestrated a sham kidnapping in Kainginyo, Thimbiri location, before audaciously demanding Sh6 million ransom from the ""victims"" family. 

In a classic case of misguided get-rich-quick mentality, the three, two males and a female, faked the kidnapping of the female, then called her parents with the demands lest their daughter disappeared for good.

In yet another fake gold scam implicating local and foreign scammers, DCI detectives drawn from the Nairobi Regional Headquarters have arrested three individuals suspected to have defrauded two Kenyans over USD 400,000.

The three suspects; Martha Mwikali Katumo, James Mwenda and Calvin Onyango Magak were smoked out of their burrow located at White Pearl apartments in Westlands, along Rapta Road where 10.2Kgs of fake gold pellets and a weighing machine were recovered.

Preliminary Investigations have revealed that the businessmen were introduced to the conmen by a Namimbian national where they met over a cup of coffee that would later usher them into a business deal that has cost them an arm and a leg as of now.

The deal also implicates another individual who is alleged to have been a mines and geology expert and is said to have tested the first consignment of 5Kgs of gold and given it a clean bill of health.

He was arrested at Lukenya area in Athi River while on board a Dreamline bus where he was suspected to have been running away from investigators. 

The four and others who are still being sought are believed to have been involved in abduction and subsequent gang rape/sodomy of Bruce John Kajira on 12th September, 2024.

Investigations have revealed that on the material day, the victim was accosted by a gang of over 10 individuals riding on motor bikes while in his house at Bamburi Mwisho where they forced their entry into his house by breaking his door.

The victim was thereafter abducted and taken to an unknown location where he was assaulted and gang raped/ sodomized. 

Investigations have further revealed that while all this was going on, the perpetrators were in constant communication with the planners for guidance on the next cause of action and alleged financial support to facilitate their movement. After they were through with the heinous acts, they placed the victim inside a sack and dumped him at a thicket while unconscious. 

Later in the evening, the victim is said to have gained consciousness and was assisted by a good Samaritan to find his way out of the wilderness and locate his home. His close friends took him to Coast General and Referral Hospital, but he was allegedly denied treatment forcing them to proceed to Beyond Scope Hospital in Kisauni where he was admitted. 

The matter was reported at Bamburi Police Station vide OB. 32/13/09/2024 and investigations  commenced. Statements were thereafter recorded and crucial evidence collected some of which has been subjected to forensic analysis. 

Today 23/9/2024 the suspects were arraigned at Shanzu Law Court no. 4 where they were charged with Conspiracy to commit a felony contrary to section 393 of the Penal Code, Abduction with intent to confine contrary to section 259 of the Penal Code, Gang Rape contrary to section 10 of the Sexual Offences Act number 3 of 2006 and Assault causing actual bodily harm contrary to section 251 of the Penal Code where they pleaded not guilty.

The court adjourned till 26th September, 2024 when it will deliver a ruling on their application to be released on bond or bail. The accused persons have been remanded at Shimo la Tewa Prison.

Investigations are on-going where it is expected that more suspects who were adversely mentioned and are connected to the heinous acts will be arrested and arraigned.

Ezekiel Sakwa Mwangi, also known as Kwame, a 19-year-old suspect linked to several heinous crimes in Rongai sub-county, Nakuru County, has been arraigned before the Nakuru High Court and charged with four counts of murder.

Mwangi’s arrest on August 18, 2024, set off a chain of legal proceedings, beginning with his arraignment at the Molo Law Courts the following day. The Molo Magistrate Court granted detectives a 30-day window to delve deeper into the case, a task that was soon taken over by homicide detectives from the DCI headquarters.

The investigation uncovered a gruesome timeline of events spanning from July to August 2024. Mwangi is suspected to have sexually assaulted and murdered four women, including a minor. 

The horror began on July 13, 2024, when five-year-old Alice Ayuma was found dead in a maize plantation in the Mwangaza area, her body bearing the marks of a brutal assault with a rungu. The violence continued on August 5, 2024, when Virginia Njeri Mwangi met a similar fate at the Menengai prayer cave.

 The following day, in Kalyet village, 34-year-old Florence Mueni Mwalimu was struck down, and her body discarded in a bush. The killing spree culminated on August 7, 2024, along the railway line at Baraka Estate, where Vellah Moraa Mogambi was attacked and fatally wounded.

When presented before court, Mwangi pleaded not guilty to all charges and sought release on bond, a request that was firmly opposed by the ODPP. The case is set for mention on October 15, 2024.

The Directorate of Criminal Investigations remains steadfast in its mission to combat violence against women and children. The public is urged to always report cases of gender-based violence to the police for action and to ensure justice for the victims.

 In a bizzare case of Matatu operators and passengers on the face value but dangerous thugs in reality, hawk eyed Operations Support  Unit (OSU) detectives have arrested a gang of six men who have been posing as matatu operators in Parklands only to turn against passengers, rob them of their valuables, kidnap others and later abandon them after completing their evil mission.

The six hoodlums who have been operating while on board a matatu Reg. No. KAQ 654A were arrested following a tip off from a member of the public. The said informer happened to have witnessed the accident where another vehicle was hit and badly damaged by the said matatu along Kipande road. Prior to the accident, the robbers had kidnapped and robbed a passenger only to be involved in an accident after which they fled the scene.

On the fateful day, the thugs who were posing as matatu operators heading to town are reported to have picked a passenger at Kempinski only for part of gang members to disembark from the matatu leaving the lady at the mercy of their fellow robbers.

Upon starting their mission, the lady started screaming and calling for help causing the robbers to panic causing an accident that gave them up to a hawk eyed member of public who later confided in the DCI on what she had discovered on the fateful day.

Immediately after receiving the tip, a quick witted team of OSU detectives was assembled and sent on a mission that has led to the arrest of Boniface Wachira Mwangi, Jackson Kimani Thuo, Titus Mburu Njonjo, Dennis Omondi Otieno, George Vincent Otieno and John Waweru Njenga (A receiver who was found in possession of 5 mobile phones and one tablet). 

As efforts to arrest a female gang member who is still at large gain momentum, we appeal to anyone who may have fallen victim to the activities of this gang to come forward and make a report at DCI Headquarters Operations Directorate for further action.

Detectives drawn from the Nairobi Regional Headquarters have arrested two suspects; Erick Okinda Blessings alias DJ and Derick Indimuli Barasa who are believed to be the faces behind use of stolen prominent individuals' photos to create fake profiles on Whatsapp and thereafter using them to commit crimes.

In one such case reported by a female Nairobi resident, the two used her photograph to create multiple fake WhatsApp profiles before embarking on a scamming spree while impersonating her.

In their scheme, the suspects pooled mobile numbers belonging to various county 1st ladies, to whom they then sent messages alleging to have influence over some upcoming tenders provided they got kickbacks upfront.

Upon receipt of the complaint, argus-eyed detectives commenced investigations leading to the arrest of Erick Okinda at Utawala Estate, in whose  premises were found two sim cards registered in fictitious names similar to the ones used in the scam under investigations.

After a brief interrogation and in the company of the first suspect, the hawkshaws proceeded to the Nairobi Central Business District where they nabbed Derrick Indimuli who was found with several pre-registered sim cards believed to have been fashioned for use to commit criminal activities.

A scan at police records revealed that the two have previously been arrested for a similar crime where they had personated a Cabinet Secretary, indication that the duo may be involved in such multiple crimes.

As detectives process the two chiselers for arraignment, members of the public are advised to remain alert and to always undertake due dilligence  as use of stolen identity is on the rise.",en,Tweet,6,146,32,52,29419,2024-09-12 21:15:52,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/android"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for Android</a>",,,photo,"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GXTHLq7XwAA08Pi.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GXTHLzAXcAAa3h5.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GXTHLy5WwAAInvF.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GXTHLy3WUAANI9b.jpg"

In an unrelenting quest to curb the illicit trade of narcotics, yet another successful narcotic seizure has taken place, showcasing the determined efforts of officers based at Butula Police Station.

Acting on intelligence, the officers pursued a motorcycle suspected to be transporting marijuana along the Butula-Matungu road. Upon realizing that law enforcement officers were closing in on them, the traffickers swiftly altered their course, attempting to evade capture. However, their efforts were in vain as the vigilant officers pursued them onto Benga University Road. In a daring move, the traffickers hastily offloaded their illegal cargo at the roadside, disguised beneath a stack of second-hand clothing.

Uncovering the deceitful concealment, the officers unearthed 1800 rolls of 45-centimetre-long marijuana, valued at approximately Sh1.8 million.

The recovered narcotics were taken to Butula Police Station for safe custody as exhibits, as efforts to trace the elusive traffickers are underway.

'1834238296785887335',"SHAKAHOLA CASE HEARING UPDATES

In one of the court sessions, a witness recounted the events leading to Mackenzie and his followers acquiring and relocating to the expansive Shakahola land. The witness shared that he had resided in Shakahola for 42 years on a piece of land that had been owned by his family for decades. Mackenzie approached him to purchase 10 acres for Ksh 50,000, and the deal was finalized and signed in 2020 at Mackenzie's Church in Furunzi, Malindi. Following this transaction, settlers began occupying the land.

Another witness described their efforts to persuade their younger brother, a follower of Paul Mackenzie, to send his two children back to school, to no avail. Despite numerous family meetings to emphasize the importance of education, their brother remained unmoved.

The witness also detailed how their brother would bring CDs and DVDs home to watch with the family, attempting to persuade them to join Paul Mackenzie’s Good News International Church. In 2020, the witness learned that their brother was in Shakahola after he had disappeared for some time. It was reported that while in Shakahola, their brother's two children had perished not due to illness, but from hunger resulting from fasting, in line with Mackenzie's teachings.

In an attempt to rescue their brother, the witness and their cousin journeyed to Shakahola but were denied entry by strategically stationed sentries. The witness promptly informed their family in Malindi of the situation, urging them to report it to Malindi Police Station, while they returned home. Subsequently, an operation was arranged to rescue individuals in Shakahola, and the witness's brother was successfully rescued. However, the fate of the brother’s wife and two children, who were also in Shakahola, remains uncertain.

The final witness to testify today disclosed the existence of an unregistered group called the Malindi Group, comprising approximately 40 members, with the intention of poultry farming in the Shakahola area. The group identified available land parcels in Shakahola for potential purchase and met with the Mwabaya Mwaro clan, the owners of the land. Subsequently, the clan sold 500 acres of land adjacent to Paul Mackenzie’s Shakahola land to the group.

In April 2023, while putting beacons on the purchased land, the group heard cries for help emanating from a bush within Mackenzie’s land. Upon approaching the distressed voices, they discovered four emaciated women in dire need of assistance. Unfortunately, their efforts to aid the women were thwarted by armed sentries loyal to Mackenzie. Upon their return to Malindi, the group reported the incident to Malindi Police Station, which led to a subsequent rescue operation.

In the ongoing hearing of the Shakahola massacre at the Chief Magistrate’s Court in Mombasa, a protected witness has shed light on the chilling influence of Paul Mackenzie, who used biblical verses like Colossians 2:8, Ecclesiastes 12:12, 1 Timothy 6:20, and Jacob 3:15 to persuade young children to abandon their education.

The witness, who converted from Islam to Christianity under the sway of his father, a fervent Mackenzie follower, left school in 2020, captivated by Mackenzie’s teachings. He painted a vivid picture of his father’s transformation from an alcoholic to a devout follower, glued to Mackenzie’s sermons on Times TV in 2019, eventually drawing the entire family into the fold.

By August 2019, the family had become regular attendees of the Good News International Church in Makongeni, Nairobi, where the witness was baptized and given a Christian name. The witnesses recounted how Mackenzie, with the aid of George Mwaura, delivered powerful sermons that left a lasting impact.

The witness narrated how his mother closed her salon after Mackenzie preached against women braiding their hair or using beauty products. Furthermore, when the Kenyan government launched the Huduma Number registration, Mackenzie warned his followers against it, claiming the microchip in the Huduma Card was the “mark of the beast” as foretold in Revelations 16-18.

“In April 2022, my father sold our household items, including our television and bed, and we journeyed to Mackenzie’s church in the Furunzi area of Malindi. There, a church member welcomed us and escorted us to Shakahola,” the witness recounted.

“Upon our arrival in Shakahola, we were allocated a plot of land by one of Mackenzie’s assistants. My days were spent hunting, sleeping, or reading the Bible. However, Mackenzie later declared that it was time to be guided by the Holy Spirit instead of the Bible. He instructed us to fast and pray in solitude, awaiting Jesus’ return to take us to Heaven,” the witness’s statement read, echoing the harrowing experiences shared by previous witnesses.

Overwhelmed by the fasting, the witness described his daring escape through dense forests to evade Mackenzie’s sentries, eventually reaching Shakahola Madukani, where he slept under the stars for three days. A kind-hearted Samaritan then offered him a job at a hardware store, where he worked for several months.

The witness was eventually rescued by a children’s officer and taken to Malindi Children Centre for care and protection. 

He concluded his testimony by expressing uncertainty about his father’s fate, who remained in Shakahola and had been recruited by Mackenzie as a gravedigger.

New details about the Shakahola massacre came to light as the trial of Paul Mackenzie and his co-defendants advanced at Mombasa Law Courts. Two witnesses, under the protection of the Witness Protection Agency, testified today.

From one of the witnesses, the court heard that Mackenzie referred to his followers as ""Wateule"" while those out of Shakahola were regarded as non-followers and were branded ""watu wamataifa."" The witness narrated to the court how her mother learned of Paul Mackenzie from watching his preaching on TV while they resided in Eldoret.

As the witness explained, her mother tried to influence Mackenzie’s teachings to her husband, an idea that led to their disagreement. The witness told the court that the mother moved to Kitale before going to Madukani in Malindi, where Mackenzie arranged for someone to pick them up and take them to Shakahola.

While in Shakahola, the witness disclosed that Mackenzie called for a meeting and instructed his followers to fast until death to see Jesus. Sometimes, the witness would break the fast and steal food, but he faced severe physical punishment when caught. When he could no longer bear to fast, the witness escaped from Shakahola, but was later arrested and taken back by the ""wazee"".

Thankfully, the witness successfully executed another escape plan from Shakahola, a place he said was heavily guarded. After being rescued, he explained to the court that he learned about his mother’s passing from a counsellor during a counselling session in Malindi.

The second witness informed the court that children who disobeyed Mackenzie’s fasting instructions were tied with ropes and subjected to physical torture. Further, he exposed how Mackenzie had lined up the order of fasting to death. In a meeting that the witness attended, Mackenzie had ordered that children will be first to fast, then the youths who will be followed by women and later men. 

Furthermore, the witness stated that Mackenzie had positioned himself to be the last to die, a testimony that was also presented during yesterday’s hearing by another witness. He also described how he was fortunate to devise an escape plan after several failed attempts.

The Chief Magistrate Hon. Alex Ithuku dropped charges against two accused in the same case following their deaths. The court made the ruling yesterday after death and post-mortem reports were presented to Hon. Ithuku.

The reports indicated that two individuals passed away due to illness while receiving care at different medical facilities. Mary Mbita, the 57th accused, died in June while undergoing treatment at Coast General Teaching and Referral Hospital, while Edison Safari, also known as Baba Sifa and the 27th accused, passed away on August 19, 2024 while receiving care at Shimo la Tewa Health Facility.

The two individuals are suspected of having scammed a Swiss National over Ksh 52 Million and were ready to fleece him more today just before the lynx-eyed detectives pounced on them.

The victim fell into the hands of the two scammers after he was informed by his ailing father who had worked in Ghana that about twenty years ago, he acquired some property in Ghana which he later sold and left the proceeds under the custody of a trustee in Ghana. 

In pursuit of this treasure, he connected with a Ghanian lady namely Mamee Efua Esong who was the translator during the transaction and  proceeded to contact and meet her in the year 2020.

This lady claimed to be familiar with his father's earlier transactions and confirmed to him that the proceeds of the sale of the property were available to a tune of USD 62.8 million but the same needed a special purpose company for ease of trasfer.

The Swiss national was tricked into registering a company that was to be used to transfer the money to his home country but not before paying taxes and facilitation money to the scammers in Ghana, Dubai, Tanzania, Uganda and later Kenya all in a bid to have his father's consignment move to Switzerland.

While in Kenya, he was introduced to Mr. Richard Olaf Heinig who would later enjoin Mr. Julius Muthuri Kirimi in November, 2023 who claimed to own Lawsam Security Company which was hired to transport and store the cargo which was allegedly inspected and stored in a Nairobi airport where he would later be denied access to the containers forcing him to part with approximately USD 400,000 to the suspects in facilitation fees.

After spending a fortune, he realized that he had been scammed where he filed a complaint at the Kenyan Mission in Switzerland. The matter was referred to the DCI through the Ministry of Foreign and Diaspora Affairs where the investigations leading to the arrest of the scammers were commenced.

The Directorate of Criminal Investigations sends a strong warning to anyone whose mission is to reap where they have not sown, that their days are numbered.",en,Tweet,18,245,43,75,50619,2024-09-09 17:53:16,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/android"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for Android</a>",,,photo,"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GXC8DbxXoAAUp1m.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GXC8DedWcAA3om0.jpg"

While hearing testimony by a protected witness, Mombasa Chief Magistrate Court today heard that Paul Mackenzie had scheduled his family last on the list of those who will die to see Jesus. Such was his preaching to his followers in 2022 in Shakahola.

The minor who was rescued by law enforcement officers during the tragic event narrated sequentially to the court the events leading up to their relocation to Shakahola and how his mother decided to withdraw him from school to join Mackenzie’s program in Shakahola.

Just like in the Bible, the witness revealed how Mackenzie had divided Shakahola into Judea, Tiro, Sidoni, Emaus, Capernaum and Galileo. 

Vividly, he recounted the meeting at the ""Mitola"" tree, where Mackenzie initiated “fasting until death” saying that Jesus would not return, and so he instructed them to fast until death to see him.

During their time at Shakahola, the witness stated that they were prohibited from attending school because it was not part of God’s plan. Additionally, if someone fell ill, they were not allowed to seek medical treatment.

The hearing of Mackenzie and his co-accused is scheduled to continue tomorrow September 10, 2024.

An operation conducted by the Anti-Narcotics Unit (ANU) officers domiciled at the DCI headquarters led to the apprehension of two notorious drug traffickers, Teresia Nduku a Kenyan and Simba Kitwana Khamri, a Tanzanian national, in Dohnholm Nairobi. 

Following their capture, the cunning suspects guided detectives to their abode in Manyanzani area in Tala Kangundo Sub-County. During a thorough search of their house, authorities unearthed a backpack with a cunningly concealed compartment housing cannabis sativa, alongside a digital scale and various incriminating documents. 

Investigation revealed that this is a unique type of cannabis sativa that originated from foreign lands and infiltrated Kenya via the Namanga border. It was further revealed that the Tanzanian suspect came to Kenya as a maestro in skilful packaging and disguising the illicit drug in backpacks for distribution to consumers worldwide. 

According to intelligence reports, the street value of 1 gram of this particular cannabis sativa is Ksh. 8000. Nevertheless, more analysis will be conducted to unravel its distinctiveness. 

Currently, the traffickers are in lawful custody, for processing before they face the full force of the law.",en,Tweet,66,921,168,607,191729,2024-09-08 10:05:25,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,photo,"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GW8HJ1yWgAAqgQB.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GW8HNKJWIAEED9Y.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GW8HUSLXEAAv-OK.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GW8HU-DWMAEBXt2.jpg"

In the ongoing battle against trafficking in narcotics, smugglers are constantly finding new tricks to outsmart the authorities and hide their illegal goods. 

In Siaya, a brazen trafficker attempted to ship a suspicious package to Mombasa. Using a nylon sack to conceal his cargo, the trafficker's plan seemed foolproof. However, as the package was being inspected at the booking office, the trafficker vanished into thin air, setting off alarm bells for the vigilant attendant. Sensing something fishy, the attendant alerted the police, and a swift response was mounted.

Upon opening the sack, the officers were greeted by a surprising sight – a layer of raw bananas. But beneath the bananas lay a whopping 245 long rolls of cannabis sativa, weighing 17.5 kilograms.

The seized narcotics were swiftly taken to the safe confines of Siaya Police Station, as relentless pursuit for the elusive trafficker is currently underway. 

The Directorate of Criminal Investigations reaffirms its commitment in the war against trafficking in narcotics, as it strives to stay one step ahead of the ever-evolving tactics of these cunning individuals.

The long arm of the law caught two individuals red-handed as they tried to butter up DCI officers with a hefty bribe of Sh179,000 to turn a blind eye to a notorious car theft suspect. 

Eugene Kiprop Kipchirchir, 38, and Hillary Kiplangat Kibet, 40, thought they could pull a fast one on the police, but their plan went up in smoke when they were apprehended by officers from DCI Kondele. These audacious culprits spun a web of lies, claiming to possess crucial information about a well-known fugitive involved in car theft. However, their yarn quickly unravelled when they attempted to grease the officers' palms with the hefty bribe to keep the fugitive from facing justice.

During the subsequent interrogation, the schemers spilled the beans, leading the officers to swoop down on a parking lot at Dondez restaurant and nab the main suspect, Rashid Oyondi Nyanuba, who was hiding inside an Isuzu double cab with the license plate KAW 092Y. 

As a result of their ill-advised scheme, the culprits are now cooling their heels at Kondele Police Station, awaiting their date in court.

In the ongoing crackdown on illicit drugs, law enforcement officers have made more arrests and seizures. At a roadblock along Nambale Busia road, two traffickers, among them a 17-year-old juvenile, were caught red-handed with a stash of Marijuana valued at Sh1, 320,000.

The suspects, Okuchil Ayubu, 40, and the daring juvenile offender, were ejected from a Toyota Hiace Matatu after being flagged down by officers at the said roadblock. Upon inspecting their bags, officers seized five bales of Marijuana, weighing 44 kilos.

Meanwhile, in Biamati area along Mutemorabu Boembu road, vigilant citizens tipped off police officers from Isebania Police Station about notorious traffickers stashing sacks of marijuana in a secret bush hideout, ready for transportation. With a swift response, the officers managed to secure a major bust, recovering five and a half sacks of Bhang weighing a staggering 260kgs, with an estimated street value of Sh7, 800,000. The suspects, however, pulled off a daring escape into the nearby thicket, leaving the officers hot on their trail.

The suspects are in Police custody undergoing processing pending arraignment, while ongoing efforts are being made to track down the suspects who managed to evade capture. The recovered narcotics are securely held as exhibits.

The Directorate of Criminal Investigations extends its utmost gratitude to the public for sharing valuable information and stands firm in its commitment to counter trafficking in narcotics.

'1829965691505516766',"ARREST OF FAKE GOLD SCAMMERS

Three individuals are cooling their heels at a Nairobi detention facility following their arrest by detectives after they scammed two foreign nationals over Ksh 340 Million in a fake gold scam deal.

The scam was started in June, 2022 when Mr Marco Colombo Conti, a business associate of Mr Satbinder Singh, travelled to Kenya with the intention of buying 100kg of gold from Mr Allain Mwadia Nvita. For a start,  Mr Marco paid about 400,000 US dollars in duty and other charges through a law firm in the name of Squire AfriLaw Consult Limited. 

In return for footing the charges on behalf of the seller, he was given 12kg of gold which the seller said he was free to carry out as hand luggage and sell to recover the funds he had paid and any other fees that would be required in the course of the transaction.

This however did not happen since when he was just about to leave, the seller informed him that he could not leave with the same 12kg of gold since it was part of the bigger consignment he was purchasing from him, making a total weight of 112kg. He then advised him that he could keep the same safely in a safe box at Mysafe Vaults at the Village Market in Gigiri, Nairobi which he accepted. 

Convinced that the gold deal was still viable, he left Kenya and returned on 5th February, 2024 in the company of Mr Satbinder Singh who was interested in buying the Gold in question.

On arrival, Satbinder was introduced to Allain Mwadia Nvita who was the gold seller, Lehman John Raymond, Daniel Ogot of Patvad Trading Co. Ltd and Frank Kateti, a Tanzanian agent.

The team proceeded to discuss with the seller the possibility of buying the 112kg consignment whereby the seller, Allain Mwadia, convinced them that he was willing to provide 31kg of Gold to be carried by them out of the country and this would cover for the money that Marco had paid in the year 2022 and also for the expenses that Satbinder would further incur in the process of shipping out the 112kg after the same was bought by Satbinder.

On the same day of 5th February, 2024, Daniel Ogot invoiced Satbinder's company; Asianic Limited an amount of 162,240 Euros and 548,830 Euros respectively and instructed that these amounts be paid into an escrow account held at Stanbic Bank in the name of Mosota Abunga & Associates Advocates, LLP.

On 7th February, 2024, the same agent again Invoiced Asianic Limited a further 14,112 Euros being freight charges for the 112kg gold consignment. All these payments were made on 8th February, 2024 after their private agent Frank Kateti advised that everything was okay and the 31kg of gold were deposited into Mysafe Vaults at Village market.

On 9th February, 2024, the foreign nationals collected 31kg of gold from Mysafe Vaults at the Village Market and proceeded to the Clearing Agent (Daniel Ogot) office where the box was opened and the consignment divided into two and packed into blue metallic boxes that were sealed, signed and stamped. 

As they left for the Airport, Daniel Ogot and Frank Kateti promised to bring with them the consignment and the necessary documents to the Airport but they failed to honor their part of the bargain. With no option left, the foreigners flew out and while in Italy, Daniel Ogot informed them that an error in declaring the weight of the consignment had led to confiscation by the Customs department and in addition, their license had also been suspended.

Further, Ogot explained that the Customs department had imposed on his company a fine equivalent to 20% of the value of the consignment amounting to 1,562,000 US dollars which if not paid, then the entire consignment was at the risk of being confiscated. Satbinder flew to Kenya and paid out 1,438,460 Euros through the escrow bank account in the names Mosota Abunga & Associates Advocates, LLP hoping to rescue the said gold but he knew not that he was still being defrauded. 1/2

'1829968315134959634',"He was then taken to Forodha house within JKIA where he met a lady namely Susan Oketch who he was informed was working with the customs department who not only confirmed to him that the fine was authentic but also supplied him with some of the ownership documentation.

Satbinder travelled back to the UK on 20th March, 2024 and the scammers continued to take him into circles to a point of even sending him fake airway bills showing that the consignment would be delivered to him in Ireland. Later he became suspicious that the deal would not materialize which prompted him to write to Commissioner General KRA to establish the authenticity of the documents provided.

The matter was referred to the DCI and upon undertaking in-depth investigations, it was  established that; all the documents provided to the complainant were forged, the persons who were presented as customs officials were not KRA employees, Patvad Trading Limited was not licensed by the Ministry of Mining, Blue Economy and Maritime Affairs to trade in any minerals, the airline company confirmed that the airway bills did not originate from them and thatcumulatively, the complainant had been defrauded a total of 2,168,258.91 Euros equivalent to Ksh 341,949,292.

The three suspects have been arraigned as file on investigations into the conduct of the advocate for breach of the terms of their letter of engagement for legal services and escrow account management has been forwarded to ODPP for perusal and advice. 2/2

Abdul Razak Rehan, Mohammed Amin Suleiman, and Ebrahim Ahmed Ebrahim have been arraigned at the Milimani Law Courts for orchestrating a fraudulent scheme that duped a Pakistani national over Sh116 million.

The trio masterminded a scrap metal and car battery syndicate, enticing the unsuspecting victim to Kenya with promises of lucrative business opportunities in the sector.

Upon his arrival, Ebrahim Ahmed Ebrahim advised the victim to register a company, demanding Sh7 million for the process. The victim handed over the cash to Mohammed Amin Suleiman and Abdul Razak Rehan Shul, who posed as an accountant at the registrar of companies and a personal assistant at the Deputy President’s office, respectively.

To add insult to injury, the victim was duped into making several additional payments in the name of warehouse rent, scrap metal and battery purchases, KRA customs duties, and special permits, all amounting to a staggering Sh116 million.

A meticulous investigation, focusing on financial transactions and issued documents, revealed that all the permits were forged and did not originate from any legitimate government offices.

A manhunt ensued, and through a thorough analysis of their geo-locations and movements, the trio was finally smoked out of their hideouts and apprehended.

They were subsequently arraigned before the Milimani Law Courts, where they pleaded not guilty to the charges and were granted a bond of Sh5 million plus one surety.

The case is scheduled for mention on September 9, 2024.

The Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) reiterates its unwavering commitment to investigating all criminal cases with the utmost integrity and impartiality.

The 10 men aged between 36 and 50 are suspected to have been directly involved in the planning and execution of break-in incidents where assorted hardware goods, steel products, lubricants and motor vehicle spare parts have been reported stolen.

The suspects are believed to be involved in a range of offenses including conspiracy to defraud, forgery of official documents, stamp forgery, creating false documents, and obtaining registration through false pretenses.

Prosecution counsel James Gachoka informed the court that the DCI is investigating Benedict Mwangangi Ngala, Joel Kakuli Mwangani, Vincent Boaz Owang, Titus Wambua Kathuku, Sylvester Mwanzia Mwanthi, and Erick Omondi Ojwang.

The court also heard that the suspects are accused of defrauding numerous investors through a large-scale scheme related to land purchases and sales, potentially implicating government officials from the State Department of Lands and Physical Planning.

In an affidavit sworn by Detective Corporal Nicholas Osuri, it was revealed that the suspects were found in possession of stamps bearing the names of land registrars, land administrators, land surveyors, and advocates, although none of the suspects hold such official positions or are affiliated with these entities.

The prosecution is also requesting an ex-parte order for Joel Kakuli to be taken to Kenyatta National Hospital to retrieve a memory card he allegedly swallowed during his arrest. Preliminary attempts to recover the memory card at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport Anti-Narcotic Unit were unsuccessful.

Additionally, the police seek more time to investigate certificates of leases and title deeds with security features that were recovered.

Following credible intelligence, the DCI’s Economic and Commercial Crimes Unit detectives commenced investigations into allegations of financial impropriety and abuse office at the Kenya National Trading Corporation (KNTC). 

Investigations have revealed that Pamela Nduku Mutua, the managing director and accounting officer of KNTC, and Amos Juma Sikuku, the supply chain and logistics manager failed in their mandate to ensure importation and distribution of rice was conducted in line with the provisions of the Public Procurement and Asset Disposal Act, 2015.

It has been established that in September 2022, KNTC was tasked to import and distribute essential commodities including rice as a measure to bring down the cost of living in the country hence the KNTC board approved the management’s concept note that was to guide the importation and subsequent distribution of the said rice.

Whereas the board settled on the Specially Permitted Procurement Procedure (SPPP) under sections 114A and 107 of the PPAD Act, 2015, this was violated and instead direct procurement was undertaken which was a blatant violation of the law.

 Other conditions approved in the concept note included the use of credit financing by a financial institution in the subject of procurement and approval by the Attorney General for procurement of value above 5 billion. These conditions were also found to have been violated when the management went ahead and engaged M/S Purma Holdings Ltd by way of a consignment contract which was not provided for in the concept note.

KNTC management further went ahead and rented private container freight stations as opposed to the use of existing government storage facilities which led to increased operation costs and loss of public funds.

In line with the PPAD Act, 2015 which places responsibility of compliance on  the accounting officer, Pamela Nduku Mutua was charged with five counts of Willful Failure to Comply with Procurement Regulations whereas Amos Juma Sikuku was charged with abuse of office. Sikuku is accused of having issued a prejudicial professional opinion in a tender for bulk commodities procurement, allegedly compromising the interests and rights of the Republic hence costing taxpayers billions of shillings.

Both suspects pleaded not guilty to the charges before the Anti-Corruption Court Milimani. Pamela Nduku Mutua was granted bail of KSh 1.5 Million or a bond of Ksh 5 million with one surety of the same amount while Amos Juma Sikuku was granted bail of Ksh 500,000 or a bond of Ksh 1 million.

'1816701810771419287',"RT @ODPP_KE: The 7th prosecution witness in the Shakahola massacre terrorism-related case described how he was forced to aid his one-and-a-half-year-old daughter in fasting to death.

Testifying before Shanzu Senior Principal Magistrate Hon. Leah Juma, the protected witness revealed that he initially tried to protect his child. However, he eventually succumbed to pressure from elders who were enforcing the fast and monitoring the deaths. These elders were reportedly tasked by Paul Nthege Mackenzie, the prime suspect in the Shakahola massacre, to implement his radical teachings among his followers.

The witness recounted that he had no choice but to deprive his daughter of food and water, leading to her death after 15 days. He also shared that his wife died after enduring a ten-day starvation period in a makeshift tent where she had relocated.

Over the course of two days—Wednesday and Thursday—the witness provided a harrowing account of how Mackenzie's radical teachings resulted in the deaths of over 400 people in the vast Shakahola forest. He explained that many children died between January and February 2023 following Mackenzie's declaration of a fasting period. Initially voluntary, the fasting regime was later made mandatory by Mackenzie. The witness also noted that Mackenzie personally conducted burials for children who succumbed to starvation.

The witness added that he attempted to escape but was deterred by fear of capture and a lack of resources. After his child’s death, his wife moved to a makeshift tent in compliance with an order requiring fasting followers to retreat deep into the forest to evade police detection. At that time, police and families were actively searching for missing loved ones.

Following his wife's death, the witness told the court that he spent his remaining time in the forest transporting bodies from makeshift tents to burial sites and digging graves. He testified that after transporting these bodies, he began fasting but occasionally broke the fast by consuming honey and water.

The witness made these distressing revelations during his examination-in-chief, conducted by the prosecution team led by Peter Kiprop, Jami Yamina, Anthony Musyoka, Victor Owiti, Betty Rubia, and Peris Ogega.

The court adjourned the hearing until September 30, 2024, with further proceedings scheduled from October 1 to October 3, 2024, and October 28 to October 31, 2024.

The arrest is a culmination of painstaking investigations arising from a report at Langata police station where a resident of South C- Green estate 2 lost part of his money that he had withdrawn from a local bank on July 17, 2024.

It happened that the victim had left the money inside his locked motor vehicle and proceeded to shop at Uchumi supermarket in Langata only to return and find his vehicle having been broken into and all the money he had stashed in a Khaki envelope missing.

On reviewing CCTV footage from an adjacent business premise, it was established that the four-man gang onboard a white Suzuki Swift Reg. No. KDB 771T had been captured breaking into his car and taking off with his money.

Taking the bull by its horns, the detectives drawn from the elite CRIB and the Operations units launched investigations culminating in the arrest of Shaban Maingi Rashid, Steve Malvin Njagi, Johnson Muisyo Mbingu and Mashud Onyango Dax alias Sudi.

At the time of arrest, the four were onboard a Suzuki Swift Reg. No. KDH 154B but upon further search, the detectives recovered a master key and retrieved another set of number plates KDP 989N from inside the vehicle that also matched the vehicle’s insurance details.

The detectives have further established that one of the arrested thugs Shaban Maingi Rashid has previously been arrested for similar offences within Langata area and has ongoing cases before court.",en,Tweet,14,174,26,84,118299,2024-07-24 16:40:09,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/android"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for Android</a>",,,photo,"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GTQomgdXcAA8lNF.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GTQomgsWwAE5aQz.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GTQomlCXUAAgcKG.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GTQomk5W8AA4rSB.jpg"

In a determined effort, detectives in Kisii South have made a significant breakthrough in the fight against trafficking in narcotics after apprehending the prime suspect who escaped a police dragnet in the wee hours of July 10, 2024 abandoning a drug laden motor vehicle Reg. No KDP 353U.

While on routine patrol along the Kisii-Migori highway, the officers spotted a speeding Nissan Xtrail heading towards Kisii town but when signalled to stop, the vehicle initially slowed down and then bolted like a bat out of hell, running over spikes at the roadblock.

In a high-octane chase, the officers pursued the suspect’s vehicle, which eventually skidded off the road and landed in a ditch. Three occupants fled the scene, vanished into a nearby thicket leaving behind the vehicle. 

Upon searching the abandoned vehicle, the officers recovered several sacks of a green substance suspected to be cannabis sativa weighing 112.8 kg, with an estimated street value of Sh 3,384,000.

After toiling and moiling for days, the search for the suspects bore fruit yesterday when detectives, acting on a tip-off, managed to smoke out the main suspect, Samuel Omondi Audi 36, from his hideout in Kibera, Nairobi.

The suspect has been arraigned as search for his accomplices continue.",en,Tweet,1,78,11,77,28817,2024-07-23 15:55:19,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/android"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for Android</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GTLUvaeXcAAXbi6.jpg

The DCI Homicide Directorate has taken over investigations into the gruesome murder of 44-year-old Rael Cherop Biwott, whose dismembered body parts were found dumped at various places across Nandi and Uasin Gishu counties on 24th and 27th June, 2024.

The mother of four was reported missing by her husband 24 hours after she left her workplace on June 22nd at the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital, where she was working as a Senior Accountant Assistant at the billing section. 

According to the husband Francis Mwangi Ndirangu, and who is the prime suspect in the monstrous killing, the deceased went missing after sharing breakfast with him on the 23rd of June, a fact that contradicted statements by his kids and a co-accused.

Probing the case, Homicide detectives jointly with their Kapseret counterparts have so far established that the deceased left her workplace minutes to 7pm in company of her husband on June 22nd, and contrary to the suspect's testimony that they boarded a matatu home, a cctv footage obtained confirmed that they left in a Toyota Succeed hired by the husband. The wife never arrived home.

Some of the deceased's dismembered parts would only be discovered stashed in a gunny bag around noontime on June 24, dumped beside a road at Kapsilegaa village within Nandi County.

Later that day, another set of the body (head and upper limbs) were discovered beside a road at Lamaiywet village within Uasin Gishu County. It was after this discovery that the husband made a missing person report at Eldoret Police Station at 6.40pm.

Three days later (June 27), the deceased's remaining parts which included her legs and internal parts were discovered in a clear polythene bag beside a road at Mutwot village in Nandi County.

An autopsy report conducted in the presence of the husband, other family members and two advocates indicated that the deceased had suffered severe neck injuries and blunt force trauma to the head.

Following the inconsistencies of the husband's report to the overwhelming circumstantial evidence so far gathered implicating him, he was arrested alongside his suspected accomplice, and both have since been arraigned and custodial orders granted to the detectives to complete the investigation.

The matter will be mentioned at the Eldoret court on July 11, 2024.",en,Tweet,14,240,40,85,71382,2024-07-11 16:45:52,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/android"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for Android</a>",,,,

Three individuals suspected of being part of an organized criminal group that targets landowners in Eldoret have been arraigned at the Chief Magistrate Court in Eldoret, thanks to Land Fraud Investigations Unit (LFIU) detectives from DCI Headquarters. 

Paul Kirwa Samoei, Julius Kipkosgei Ruto and Tamar Cheptoo Birgen were arraigned following comprehensive investigations, after the three fraudsters used a forged Title Deed to file an application before court, thereby obtaining an eviction order used to evict genuine land owners on October 7, 2022. 

In the fraudulence, four victims lost their 20 acre parcel of land which they had been legally occupying since 2001, a land located at Ngeria area of Kapseret constituency in Uasin Gishu County.

Investigation were initiated following a letter received at the DCI headquarters on January 31, 2024, from the affected landowners. The letter requested an inquiry into the suspicious acquisition of a title deed on their land, which was registered as PIONEER/NGERIA BLOCK 1(EATEC)/1980. However, the genuine victims claimed to have purchased the same land from East African Tanning Extract Company Limited (EATEC) in 2001.

Painstaking investigations revealed that the Ministry of Lands did not issue the title deed used by the fraudsters. Furthermore, the title deed was not printed by Government Printers, and no records of its issuance were found in the land registry presentation book.

Additionally, the green card for the land was not serialized, as it was not captured in the Uasin Gishu County land registry data. 

A document examiner's report also indicated that stamps and signatures on an acknowledgement note showing payment for the land to the late Hon. Mark Too in the presence of advocate Paul Birech had been forged.

Consequently, 7 counts have been preferred against the suspects, who pleaded not guilty and were released on a Sh500,000 bond. The pretrial has been scheduled for July 22, 2024 at Eldoret's court no. 5.",en,Tweet,20,354,63,167,87312,2024-07-10 10:44:35,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/android"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for Android</a>",,,photo,"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GSHQ9foaUAAmznO.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GSHQ9ewWcAArgw2.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GSHQ9fCXYAAKH3d.jpg"

Posing as demonstrators, the bad elements who were also well-organized earmarked several business premises including boutiques, electronic shops and supermarkets, breaking in and massively looting to the detriment of innocent business owners.

As a criminal investigative agency, it squarely falls within the mandate of the DCI to investigate and bring to book any persons involved in such outright criminality, which not only robbed numerous Kenyans their means of livelihood, but also worked towards compromising an otherwise crucial constitutional right.

In that regard, the DCI’s Imaging and Acoustic Unit domiciled at the National Forensic Laboratory has since retrieved numerous CCTV footages that captured identifiable persons, whose felonious acts isolates them from the hundreds of thousands that stuck to their course.

Whereas some have already been arrested and arraigned in various courts today, more are still out there on the streets waiting for other opportune times to strike again, causing more damage and risking the lives of innocent citizens caught up in the course of quelling the crimes.

In the abominable incident whose investigation has been going on since June 16, 2024, two men aged 42 and 63, and who are believed to have a land tussle with the minor's dad, were found to have planned the girl's abduction by 21-year-old Elijah Dadi Robert, thereafter holding her hostage at an abandoned posho mill.

She was abducted while going home from a local school within Mitangoni area.

The men identified as Karisa Kashindo, 42 and his security man Nderi Magure Mwatsuma alias Ubwete, 63 are said to have stood guard and watched as the third suspect repeatedly defiled the minor, threatening to kill her should she expose the beastly act to anyone.

Sneaking her to her home in the cover of darkness, the girl was made to pack a few clothes before she was again whisked away on a motorcycle to Shariani area at a makuti house within Makata village, to her trauma and the agony of her desperate parents amidst frantic search by the local police.

While at Makata, the victim who has since been rescued and reunited with her family revealed that her abductors brought in several other young men who also defiled her, two of whom were identified and arrested yesterday.

In the case, Mary Mwende reportedly stabbed her ex-boyfriend three times on the chest using a kitchen knife, after a tiff that sundered their once dazzling love. After the heinous attack, she went underground, carefully effacing the track behind her.

Mwende did not only hole up, but also cut communication with her family, known friends and has since avoided places she previously frequented hence paralyzing efforts to bring her to justice.

The proverbial fortieth day of a murder suspect believed to have slain his 63-year-old employer in Murang'a on 22nd September, 2022 has finally dawned after over 20 months of holing up, a period that subjected the affected family to untold grief crying for justice for their kin. 

Prior to going berserk and hacking his boss to death, Fred Cheluba Murunga (the suspect) worked as the deceased's farmhand for one and a half months, staying at his home located at Kerandi village in Kigumo, Murang'a County.

The report booked at Ngonda Police Station indicated that on the fateful morning, the suspect sent a 12-year-old grandchild of the late Mzee Paul Njuguna Kamau to a nearby shop, and while he was away, turned against his employer with a machete.

The juvenile would only return moments later to find his grandfather locked up in the kitchen, crying in agonizing pain. Apparently, the rest of the family members were away, and the young boy had gone to visit the aged man to get him some breakfast.

The minor raised alarm, drawing the attention of the villagers who thronged the homestead. Jointly with the local police who had also learnt of the incident, the responders broke into the kitchen only to stumble upon Mzee's body soaked in blood, stiff and lifeless. Beside him lay the suspected murder weapon, a machete.

Enraged neighbours who bayed for Cheluba's blood searched for him unsuccessfully. Not only was he missing, but so were the deceased's motorcycle and mobile phone.

Taking up the case, Kigumo DCI officers activated manhunt for the killer farmhand, with preliminary investigations revealing that the deceased's motorbike and mobile phone were sold out in Eldoret.

With each passing day, the affected family's hope tailed off, but the detectives maintained their focus and put the suspect on police radar, further seeking the intervention of their counterparts from DCI HQS Crime Research and Intelligence Bureau (CRIB).

Man who attempted to rape a 22-year-old woman after offering her a ride in his car is recuperating at a Kiambu hospital, after another attempt to commit suicide flopped.

In the incident reported at Kandara Police Station in Murang'a on Wednesday, the woman was walking home from Kaburigi trading centre that evening when the motorist offered her a lift.

Innocently, the young woman boarded the vehicle, unaware that she was dancing to the tune of a marauding wolf in sheep skin.

But even before she could warm her seat, the 'Good Samaritan' mutated fast into a savage, attempting to force issues and organs that the beautiful lady wouldn't agree to.

Putting up a spirited fight with screams and shrieks as her backup, the victim managed to unlock the vehicle and hopped out, scathed but pure.

She reported the matter to the police, who upon investigation identified the suspect as Peter Gitau Kimani.

Meanwhile, Kimani got wind that he had been unmasked, and that hawkshaws were hot on his trail. Overcome by the fear of prison life coupled with the shame and guilt of his actions, he downed a bottle of poison.

But neither heaven nor hell was ready to receive him without clearing with the third planet first. Before he could succumb, the police showed up at his house and rushed him to Thika Level 5 hospital where he is admitted but in stable condition.

Once discharged, Kimani will be charged accordingly in an open court.

Police in Busia are hot on the trail of two suspected drug traffickers who slipped through their dragnet yesterday, leaving behind seven sacks of refined bhang estimated to be worth Sh13 million in the streets. 

While on routine beat and patrol duties in the wee hours of the day at Ratike area along the Busia-Kisumu road, the police officers stumbled upon the haul of narcotics beside the road, supposedly abandoned when its owners sighted the law enforcers. 

A quick look around nearby thickets revealed a disturbed vegetation cover, evidencing presence of hoodlums monitoring police activities, hoping to grab and flee with the cargo should they get a chance.

Unfortunate for them, the officers camped at the site awaiting a police vehicle that bundled the entire 451kg haul and booked it at Busia Police Station.

With the exhibit secured, the officers have embarked on hunting down the daring miscreants.

Six suspects including four police officers believed to have trailed the accountant of Rophine International School from a bank in Utawala on Monday afternoon before breaking into his car and disappearing with Sh2.2 million have been arrested.

The six, three of whom are a police sergeant, a corporal and a constable from Kasarani Police Station, a police constable from Ruai police station and two civilians were arrested at the Kasarani Police Station public parking yard, by a combined team of sleuths from DCI Nairobi region and Kayole sub-county.

A total of Sh473,000 believed to be part of the stolen amount was also recovered from the six, who were ambushed in the stations official police vehicle.

In the earlier incident reported at Mihang'o Police Station at 4pm Monday, the accountant had withdrawn an amount in excess of the Sh2.2 million that was stolen, intended for the payment of casual workers at the said school.

Unbeknownst to him (or otherwise), sheer-greed miscreants using a saloon car Reg. No. KCR 959D were hot on his trail right from when he parked his car outside the bank to when he left with the load of cash.

The accountant had then parked his car outside the school, taken some amount from the withdrawn sum, locked the car and entered the school compound. Allegedly, he could not carry the whole amount.

Minutes later when he went back to pick more cash, he found the car broken into and the millions missing.

Meanwhile, DCI officers from Nairobi region and Kayole obtained crucial actionable intelligence and proceeded to Utawala area in pursuit of a suspect they had identified from CCTV analysis.

On arrival, the team learnt that the suspect had been picked moments earlier by unknown people driving in a Subaru car.

Further intelligence led the team to the Kasarani station, where the six were ambushed in a GK vehicle and forced to identify themselves in the presence of the Sub-County Police Commander, his deputy and the Sub-County Criminal Investigations Officer.

They identified as Sgt Antony Ndegwa Anwal, Cpl Daniel Lekakeny Sunkuli, PC Simon Macharia Maina (of DCI Kasarani), PC Antony Mwenda (KPS Ruai), Lukas Magwaga and Young Wakise.

A 25-year-old Robbery with Violence suspect believed to have murdered the manager of Chandarama Supermarket located within Buffalo Mall in Naivasha on May 22, 2024 has been arrested.

Joseph Mungai Wanjira was flushed out of his hideout within Naivasha town at 1pm today, following days of scrupulous search for the cold-blooded killer.

In the May 22 incident, workers at the supermarket had arrived at the Mall early that morning, hoping to find the doors open as was norm.

After waiting up long enough, they decided to call the manager on duty (the late Mr Hassan Abdullatif Salim) to find out why he was taking too long to report to work.

His phone went unanswered, prompting a few supervisors to check him out at his house. Shock struck when they were met with blood spots at the door, although the house was locked.

Police in Naivasha were informed. They rushed to the scene, and upon forcing entry, found the body of the 38-year-old manager sprawled on the floor in a pool of blood, cold. Signs of struggle depicting an attack were evident, with various household items notably missing.

Crucial evidence including the retrieval of CCTV footages were obtained and the scene documented by CSI detectives, as pursuit for the perpetrator(s) commenced.

Today, intelligence analysis gave away the prime suspect, in whose possession were found most of the items stolen from the deceased's house including a TV set, a 6kg Pro Gas, a Samsung tablet, a hoodie branded NASA and a blood-stained bag.

After a brief interrogation, the suspect led detectives to the scene of crime (deceased's house), retrieving the two murder weapons he had used (kitchen knife and a piece of wood).

Further documentation of the scene has since been conducted and the suspect booked in Naivasha police cells pending arraignment for Robbery with Violence.

Detectives from Nairobi Regional Headquarters have arrested five suspects believed to be the masterminds behind a fraudulent recruitment drive for overseas jobs within Nairobi and its environs.

A foreign national namely Nick Van Opstal, Samuel Marigi, Patrick Wangai, Susan Oluoch and Christine Muthoni Wangechi were arrested following a tip-off from the public about activities of two suspicious recruitment agencies namely Alhanawa Jobs and Supply Link Ventures Ltd who were purporting to be recruiting for overseas jobs at KCB sports club grounds.

Following the swift response by the detectives, approximately 1000 jobseekers were snatched from the fangs of the snake oil merchants whose sole mission was to fleece them off their hard earned cash.

Pleliminary Investigations revealed that the National Employment Authority had flagged the exercise as a scam. 

Meanwhile, the hunt is on for three individuals namely Hannah Mbugua, Gladys Oluasa and Lucy Wanjiru who managed to escape the police dragnet.

Members of the public are advised to remain vigilant and to report such agencies to the police for action.

After comprehensive investigations implicating three employees of Sports, Arts and Social Development Funds (SASDF), three suspects have been arraigned for the offences of Forgery, Making a document without authority and uttering a false document at the Milimani Law Courts.

John Onyango Odhiambo, 44, Adan Bagajo Lamma, 44, and George Ereng Lotieng, 35, who were employed as drivers, were arrested for submitting fake academic certificates to secure jobs and enhance their pay grades.

John Onyango had submitted a falsified 2011 KCSE certificate from Starays Hope Community Center, Nairobi, while Adan Lamma presented a counterfeit 1998 KCSE certificate from Marsabit Boys High School despite having dropped out in form two.

Similarly, George Ereng Lotieng submitted a forged KCSE certificate from St. Marks Boys High school, Cherangany, where he had also dropped out in form two.

A report from KNEC revealed that John Onyango manipulated the grades of all the subjects he had taken to achieve a mean grade of D+ in order to meet the qualification threshold for the job. 

As for Adan, he had neither registered nor sat the said exam since the center (Marsabit Boys) under code 501512 did not exist during the 1998 KCSE examinations.

Such was the case with George Ereng, whose alleged centre of examination (St. Mark Boys High Sch) did not exist as of 2010, and the code indicated in his certificate (401057) belonged to a different school, Ruthimitu Secondary.

The suspects were charged Friday at the Milimani Law Courts.

According to the Public Service Commission, more than 2,000 government employees are culpable of using forged academic and professional qualifications to secure jobs or earn promotions.

'1788478640117702759',"PRIME SUSPECT IN USD 100,000 GOLD SCAM ARRESTED

A Congolese fake-gold scammer who in 2023 engineered fraudulent machinations that bamboozled a Ghanaian merchant into a raw USD 100,000 deal is cooling his heels in Kenyan cells after attempting a sneak-back through the Busia border.

Puati Poba Dally, 35 was intercepted by immigration officials following a stop order issued in September 2023 when the complaint was lodged at the Operations Support Unit offices in Nairobi.

In a classic case of clueless gold dealers losing millions to transnational organized ruthless gold diggers, the victim's woes and journey to destitution began when he met Puati at a hotel in Ghana over lunch hour.

Puati introduced himself as Osuman from Nigeria, who was in Ghana for business but whose residence and business addresses were in Uganda. In the course of their interaction, Puati learned that the victim was interested in the purchase and sale of gold, where he promised to introduce him to dealers in Uganda whereafter he could sell the gold in Dubai.

Armed with dollars and prayers for a smooth ride, the victim flew to Uganda on August 1, 2023 where Puati introduced him to the alleged dealers only identified as Ben and Hassan (brothers). 

The weeks that followed saw the victim tossed back and forth by the three racketeers, and with each toss came the milking of dollars to a tune of USD 71,300 (Sh10.7 million) in the name of documentation of 10kg of gold, non-criminality certification, melting and taxation. Payment for the gold which was agreed at USD 33,000 per kg was to be made upon delivery to Dubai.

Confident that he was done with all the logistical procedures, the victim boarded a UAE-bound flight on August 9 ahead of his cargo. He would days later book a flight back to Uganda on August 13 to check his gold, only to be told that it was being held at customs offices in Kenya where it had been erroneously flown through.

Boarding a flight to the Jomo Kenyatta Intn'l Airport (JKIA) the following day, the victim met Puati's accomplices only identified as Daniel and Lucy, who fleeced him of close to USD 30,000 (over Sh4.3 million) in tax and clearance of non-existent gold between August 14 and September 1, 2023 when they put him to a flight back to Dubai, in pretext that they were having a flight attendant secure his safe containing gold.

DCI OSU team would only learn of the fraud when uncontrollable screams and wails were witnessed during take-off, forcing the victim to be ejected from the flight and his complaint recorded.

Following the arrest of the prime suspect yesterday, interrogations are being conducted with a view to nab other members of the criminal syndicate.",en,Tweet,23,361,81,51,87488,2024-05-09 09:58:30,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/android"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for Android</a>",,,photo,"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GNHz1anWkAALg_N.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GNHz15HW0AAHJdP.jpg"

As the bid to rid the nation of narcotics and psychotropic substances heightens, detectives in Moyale have seized over 3.9kg of cocaine with an estimated street value of Sh15,660,000 from a woman identified as Vivian Achieng Okello.

Acting on actionable intelligence, the quick-witted officers led by the sub-county criminal investigations officer conducted a stealth operation that saw the suspect arrested at Moyale's one-stop border point while on her way back to Kenya from Ethiopia.

Hawk-eyed sleuths spotted the suspicious woman clinging onto her suitcase, who upon questioning exhibited all indicators of need for search. 

She was escorted to DCI Moyale where a thorough search was conducted, whereby the crack was discovered stashed in two smaller bags concealed in her toiletries.

Also found was USD 700 concealed under the inner soles of her shoes. 

Legal procedures have been instigated.

Mustakima Mohammed Ali, a wanted terror suspect involved in the brutal killings of a police officer and two chiefs in Lamu County in December 2019 has been arrested. 

The suspect was flushed out of a Malindi-bound bus in a Sunday afternoon operation by Anti-Terrorism Police augmented by their Special Operations Group (SOG) counterparts at the Sambaki Bridge road block while traveling from Lamu.

Mustakima Ali alias Abu Mahir and his accomplices holed up after the monstrous murders that occurred in December 2019, first hiding within Boni Forest from where they were smoked out by security personnel and disappeared to a neighboring country.

In April 2023, three members of his gang dared a return into the country but were intercepted and arrested along the Isiolo-Moyale highway while heading to Somalia. They were charged at the Kahawa Law Courts and their case is ongoing.

Other suspects who have since been identified but are still at large remain on police radar.

The DCI Homicide detectives are at advanced stages of investigation of the monstrous murder of Miss Rita Waeni, 20, whose young life was ended in January 2024 by yet to be arrested cold-blooded killer(s).

Before her tragic death, Rita Waeni, a third-year student at the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology was staying with her aunt at Syokimau in Nairobi, the home she left at 3pm on January 13, 2024, never to return alive.

Elaborate forensic analyses have so far been done by the investigating team, capturing the deceased's last moments and linking probable suspects to her murder. Further, detailed statements by persons of interest have been recorded and more data sourced from digital platforms to ensure that all leads to Rita's killer(s) are utilized.

Unfortunately, the prime suspect in the murder, a man only captured by CCTV cameras walking Rita to her scene of death remains in the holes, and the DCI Homicide team is sparing no resource in his pursuit.

In its endeavour to expedite the delivery of justice to the young soul and provide closure to the family, the Homicide Directorate calls upon anyone who can identify the man whose images (though blurry) appear on this post, to come forward and share information that may assist in his arrest.

Although his identity remains unknown, it has been established that he first initiated communication with the late Waeni on October 2, 2023 through an Instagram account in the names of Carlton Maina (pseudo), a name that was later changed several times and finally pulled down immediately after the heinous murder.

The suspect is believed to have visited several hotels in Nairobi West in October 2023 and the Green House Airbnb located in Roysambu along TRM Drive on Nov 7 and Nov 11, 2023. He is also believed to have criminal mind evidenced by his way of evading CCTV cameras. He is fluent in Swahili and English, and has knowledge of Nairobi and its environs.

Mohamed Abdi Ali alias Abu Ramzi, who has been in prison remand for 8 years following his arrest in 2016 over terrorism related activities, was today sentenced to serve 12 years in jail after the Chief Magistrate's Court Milimani found him guilty of five counts of the eight with which he was charged.

The 34-year-old suspect was arrested at a medical facility in Wote, Makueni County, where he was working as an intern medic having completed his studies at the Kampala International University between 2010 and 2015.

25 witnesses including Uganda's Counter-Terrorism detectives, US Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) agents and Kenya's Anti-Terrorism Police detectives testified in the case where Abu Ramzi was found guilty of, among others, being a member of a terrorist group (ISIS), recruitment of members of a terrorist group and possession of articles connected with the commission of a terrorism act.

Passing the sentence, the Chief Magistrate Hon. Martha Mutuku considered the gravity of the offences committed, sentencing the suspect to 12 years' imprisonment for each count, with the five jail terms running concurrently from the time the suspect was arrested in April 2016.

Nashon Otieno Angudha, a key suspect in a series of frauds affecting local and foreign gold merchants has today been arraigned at Milimani Law Courts, after he was arrested Tuesday evening for obtaining Sh35 million from a businessman in a fake gold scam.

In the fraudulent scheme orchestrated on diverse dates between July 13 and October 18, 2023, the 28-year-old is accused of swindling the victim out of the millions by luring him to a purchase and export deal of 100kg of gold to Dubai, the amount being fees for transportation and insurance.

After parting with the money which was paid in US dollars ($250,000), nine gold bars given to the victim as collateral were subjected to a test at the Ministry of Mining, but none of them exhibited even a trace of gold element.

Nashon then holed up leaving the businessman devastated and poorer, thereby seeking the intervention of law enforcers.

Acting on intelligence, the Operation Support Unit (OSU) detectives conducted a stealth operation at Crystal Spring Apartments in Lavington, Nairobi, managing to net the suspect while in his KDM 523Q Toyota Prado. Crucial exhibits including radio sets and cheque books were seized from the vehicle.

Nashon was today arraigned at court no. 5 charged with conspiracy to commit a felony and obtaining money by false pretenses. He pleaded not guilty to both charges and has been remanded until Friday, 4th April, 2024 when bond determination will be made.

The objection to release him on bond by the prosecution followed Nashon's criminal record, noting that he is implicated in a robbery with violence case at the Kibera court no. 5, for jointly with his two accomplices robbing a foreign couple over USD90,000 when they jetted the country for a gold business.

In the October 28, 2023 case, Nashon Otieno, Jack Ouma Okwiri and Felix Ochieng' Nyongesa lured an Australian man and his Ugandan wife to an office setup in the Runda suburbs, before turning against the couple.

The man was beaten up and the wife sexually assaulted, before the gang robbed and dumped them at Rehema House in Nairobi CBD.

After days of relentless manhunt, the three were arrested at the Social House Nairobi Hotel in Lavington area and arraigned at Kibera Law Courts on November 9, 2023 charged with robbery with violence.

As detectives heighten crackdowns on armed thugs that have become the nightmare of city dwellers in the Capital, three notorious robbery suspects have been rounded up in Kilimani and Athi River, and a firearm recovered among other suspected stolen properties.

The operation followed thorough forensic analysis of evidence obtained from various armed robbery scenes across Nairobi and its environs, which were staged on diverse dates from 2023.

In the resolute pursuit, detectives from DCI HQS, Starehe and Athi River joined forces in a sting operation, successfully pouncing on 39-year-old Julius Osoro Nyagoi at Nairobi's Kilimani area.

After interrogation, the suspect led the investigators to his homestead at Green Park Estate in Athi River, Machakos County. In his house no. 641, two of his accomplices; John Michael Muturi, 38 and Charity Njeri Kimani aged 34 were also arrested, before a thorough search was conducted and several exhibits recovered.

These included a Czeska pistol loaded with 7 rounds of ammunition, two pairs of motor vehicle number plates bearing Reg. Nos. KBB 027Z and KDE 399Q, assorted motor vehicle parts, several sim cards, mobile phones, two laptops, an iPad, logbooks for KCE 135W and KCQ 381A, wrist watches and ATM cards.

Also found at the parking lot were motor vehicles Reg Nos. KDC 019P Mazda Bongo, KCE 135W Toyota Noah, KCB 790B Toyota Mark X and KDE 459A Toyota Fielder, all of which were impounded for verification. 

The three suspects were then escorted to Pangani Police Station where they are being processed for arraignment on Thursday, April 11, 2024.

A firearm that was violently robbed from the Officer Commanding Vihiga Police Station when a criminal gang attacked him while on patrol on December 21, 2023 has been recovered in Mwiki, Kasarani sub-county.

One member of the gang from whose possession the Jericho pistol was recovered was also neutralized after daring a gunfight with the DCI Operations team that was trailing them.

To get the firearm, the ruthless gang had on the said date waylaid the Chief Inspector as he parked his car in Vihiga's Majengo market, descending on him with daggers and leaving him for the dead. They then disappeared with his Jericho pistol loaded with 15 rounds of ammunition.

From Toyota Kenya's description, the elegance of Land Cruiser Prado, sleek shape and its imposing grille affirm its powerful and statutory image.

Maybe, it's this magnificient description of the machine that convinced Daniel Okoth and Erick Ombima that they had the perfect vehicle to sneak 300kg of Marijuana into the country from one of our neighbours. Unbeknownst to them, no level of elegance could beat police intelligence networks.

In the company of two men, Daniel Okoth was entrusted to chauffeur Sh9 million worth of the banned sustance to Kenya through Nyametaburo route and later join Isebania - Migori highway at Mabera.

Confident of a successful mission, the trio who drove at breakneck speed approached Karamu Bridge area, unaware that the In-charge of Isebania Police Station who was privy to the itinerary had led his troops in laying an ambush.

Bumping into a police roadblock that provided a safe distance to pull over for a search, the driver opted to drive past the officers nearly running over one of them. But with their 40th day at nigh, three well-calculated rapid shots from an AK47 benumbed his accelerator foot, prematurely terminating their journey.

During the rumpus, one male occupant scampered off like a terrified rat into the thickets, but Okoth, Obima and their drug haul stuffed in the KCL 532E Prado were rounded up. The prohibited cargo numbered 6 gunny bags.

As the two suspects cool their heels at a secure room within Isebania Police Station, pursuit of the escapee is ongoing. 

Meanwhile, members of the public are encouraged to continue sharing information on traffickers, and to disengage from any drug-related activities or trade to avoid confrontations with the law.

'1767601014377443348',"UNFAITHFUL SERVANTS IN SH15M THIEVERY TO BE ARRAIGNED IN KIAMBU.

Detectives based in Kiambaa will on Wednesday, March 13, 2024 arraign at Kiambu Law Courts two female suspects who stole over Sh15.6 million from their employer within a period of 18 months, in a classic case of conspiracy and modern-day computer fraud. 

The two suspects; Judy Muringe Mugo, 41 and Catherine Waithera Ruiru, 26, are respectively the Marketing Officer and Receptionist for Goshens Real Estate based in Kiambu's Ruaka township.

In the case reported at DCI Kiambaa offices on January 23, 2024 by the company Director Mr Andrew Kirumba, the 1st suspect (Judy Mugo) was accused of duping Goshens Real Estate tenants into disregarding the paybill and bank account provided on their lease agreement forms while remitting monthly rent, and instead insisted on them using the company office line which she manned.

Being the marketing officer who also acted as liaison with the tenants and charged with the responsibility of issuing receipts to tenants who remitted their bill payments, Judy declared the company paybill and bank account ""no longer functional"", before directing that payments be channeled to the OPPO phone and number that the company issued to her for marketing purposes.

After receiving the hundreds of thousands in rent, water bills and other payable services through the office line, the 41-year-old would then transfer the money to her two personal phone numbers, thereafter transacting through mobile banking to her two accounts held at Family Bank.

To cover her trail and ensure that the management did not notice any irregularities, Judy would then conspire with the receptionist (Catherine Waithera), who manipulated numbers in the company's system to indicate that no tenants had any arrears. For doing this, the 26-year-old partner in crime would receive from Judy her unfair share of the stolen amount. This went on from June, 2022 to January, 2024. 

Hitting the ground running, the detectives commenced investigations by recording statements of all the affected tenants, then seeking orders from a Kiambu court to investigate the concerned banks and mobile money transactions. 

When the mobile transaction andbank statements were obtained, it was confirmed that indeed the marketing officer would channel the rent receivedthrough the office line to her own personalnumbers 0705736*** and 0741***559, then later channel the same to her
Family bank account numbers 042000007*** and 052000008***. In the establishments, she had also transferred Sh3,442,200 to the receptionist through her (Catherine's) mobile number 0712***840 and also her KCB account number 1250143*** within the period in question.

The painstaking probe also established that Judy, whose monthly salary was Sh30,000, had on April 14, 2023 channeled Sh750,000 toAUTOCAD Motors bank account, which AUTOCAD confirmed to have been payment for a Toyota Harrier Reg. No. KBH 252S bought from their yard. Search in the NTSA database confirmed that Judy was the legitimate owner of the car until January 25, 2024, a date when Kiambaa detectives summoned her to their offices. In an effort to defeat justice, Judy (who was released on bail pending completion of investigations) had thereafter transferred the vehicle to Andronicus Mbuthia Kamakia.

With these findings, the investigators sought a search warrant for the suspect's home where the Toyota Harrier was found parked. The filed miscellaneous application also sought orders to impound and detain the vehicle and treat it as a proceed of crime, thus preventing its sale or use as collateral in obtaining loans from any financial institutions. 

The orders executed on March 6, 2024 also saw both suspects' phones and the desktop used by the receptionist confiscated, and the same have since been submitted to the forensic cybercrime unit for detailed analysis.

In what appears to be a grand return of 'Pishori babes' now rocking nocturnal activities in Kiambu's Thika town, two damsels suspected to have stupefied a male clubber at VSpot Nightlife yesterday are behind bars.

The two women were spotted by the club supervisor who was concerned after seeing the two forcefully dragging a seemingly too drunk frequent customer to his Toyota Crown, before putting him on the driver's seat in that drunken state.

But even before he could intervene to stop the man from drink-driving, he was caught agape by a rather unexpected scene of one of the women spraying something on her breasts before she pulled the helpless male to ""breastfeed"". The man had then completely passed out.

The supervisor sought the help of a few colleagues to stop the women who were then fleeing the scene after stealing the man's ATM cards and other personal documents. 

On being alerted about the incident, police officers from Thika station rushed to the scene where they found the unconscious man lying in his car, with a bottle of alcohol at whose base settled some white precipitate. More tablets of a yet to identified drug were found on the women.

The suspects were rearrested and booked in cells as the heavily drugged man was escorted to hospital. The exhibits have since been taken to the government chemist for analysis.

We wish to caution club-goers, especially men, to be wary of such dangerously seductive criminals who lurk in bar shadows targeting vulnerable cash-rich customers, before drugging them and disappearing with their valuables.

At 3am on Valentine Day, police at Naivasha Police Station received a distressed female reportee from Mirera estate who had been accosted by a five-man gang at her house and held hostage from 9pm to 2am the same night.

The victim, Ms Nelly Cherop Kosgei reported that she was at her house with her two kids and the house help, when five men, four of whom were dressed in jungle uniforms, stormed into the house while armed with crude weapons.

After subduing the family with threats to kill if they raised alarm, they ransacked the house for valuables before disappearing with two TV sets, two laptops, a JBL sound bar and four mobile phones. The gang had then loaded the valuables in the complainant’s Nissan Dualis Reg. No. KDC 302V and sped off. Luckily, no one was physically harmed in the incident.

The robbery case was taken over by DCI Naivasha detectives who fruitlessly searched for the perpetrators in their area of jurisdiction, thus calling upon the Crime Research and Intelligence Bureau (CRIB) team based at DCI Headquarters to assist in the pursuit. The team hit the ground augmented by the Operations Action Team (OAT). 

After days of relentless pursuit by forensically analysing all possible intelligence leads, detectives proceeded to Nakuru North where they laid an ambush at Kiamunyeki area, successfully cornering one suspect namely Joseph Ndung’u Waweru.

In his possession was a black Nissan Dualis fitted with plates Reg. No. KDE 074Q. On verifying the chassis and engine numbers of the vehicle, it was discovered to have been registered under the names of Nelly Cherop Kosgei, and that the fitted plates belonged to a lorry.

Also recovered from the suspect were six sim cards, a pair of jungle green trousers, pliers, 14 steel tyre nuts, aerosol paint spray, a brown folded carton for carrying extra car registration plates and foreign currencies of different denominations including South African rand, Mauritius rupees and Uganda shillings.

After interrogation, detectives run a profiling on the arrested suspect, finding more leads to his accomplices.

On the same night of February 24 at around 2.40am, the crime researchers backed up by their Nakuru counterparts laid another ambush on two suspects on board a Mitsubishi FH truck which was being driven towards Njoro town. Upon intercepting the vehicle reg. No. KCB 383Z, Evans Mwangi Njenga, 45 and Geoffrey Kamau Hinga, 53 were nabbed, where on searching the truck another pair of Reg. no. plates (KCK 616G) were discovered. A verification of the discovered plates revealed that they belonged to a bus.

The two suspects were equally interrogated, where the detectives learnt that they were to meet with two other accomplices in Njoro town, where they were to change the truck’s registration plates and escort it across the Kenya - Uganda border. Hence, a third ambush was laid at a hardware in Njoro town, and two more suspects, Peter Mahinyo Wanyoike, 45 and Julius Gichagu Wanguno aged 32 arrested when they came calling out Mwangi and Kamau.

This made five the total number of suspects rounded up in the scrupulous manhunt. But before the detectives could call it an accomplished mission in the pursuit of justice for Nelly and her family, it emerged that they were dealing with a more ruthless gang than one could pick from their faces.

In the developments, it was discovered that the FH lorry they had intercepted had been reported robbed from a victim at Elementaita Police Station in Gilgil, when the gang turned against the driver they had hired to offer transport services.

The 38-year-old driver had been robbed, sexually molested and left tied up at Punda Milia section on February 23 by a 6-man gang, who then disabled the vehicle’s tracker and disappeared.

The attention of the Director, DCI has been drawn to a viral video circulating on social media where a lady cried foul play by two Kasarani sub-county detectives who were handling her case.

The Director DCI instructed the DCI's Nairobi Region Coordinator to launch a thorough probe into the allegations with the view of taking appropriate measures to deliver justice.

The position of the matter has been found to be as follows:

That the complainant, Irene Waithera Maina, while in Saudia Arabia wanted to send some money to her sister back in Kenya, thus went to the bank where she left a total of Ksh 413,000 and her sister's details with the teller.

She was instructed to wait for three days before the money would reflect in her sister's account, but on expiry of the period, her sister confirmed that she had not received the money.

The complainant returned to the bank only to find that the amount was erroneously deposited to a different mobile subscriber registered in the name of William Otieno.

The bank tried to reverse the transaction but only managed to reverse Ksh171,000 while the balance of Sh242,000 had already been withdrawn by the unintended recipient.

The complainant decided to board a flight to Kenya to follow up on the matter and  reported at Kasarani Police Station where the case was referred to the DCI Kasarani for action.

Two detectives were assigned the case where they launched investigations into, ""Intentionally Withholding Payment Delivered Erroneously Contrary to Section 35 of Computer Misuse and Cyber Crime Act no. 5 of 2018.""

Upon investigations, William Otieno was traced to Bande area at the Kenya-Tanzania border during the Christmas period, before he relocated to Mombasa at Likoni area.

 On January 13, 2024, the suspect was nabbed and booked at Inuka Police Station in Likoni. 
In compliance with the 24-hour rule within which a suspect must be arraigned before a magistrate, the suspect was released on a  KSh22,000 cash bail, but thereafter switched off his phone.

On February 20, 2024, the investigating officers got a tip on the whereabouts of the suspect, where they proceeded to Mombasa and managed to arrest the suspect the following day.

On February 22, the suspect was arraigned at Makadara Law Court where he was charged and granted bail of Sh200,000 with  a surety of Sh400,000. The case will be mentioned on June 18, 2024 with its hearing scheduled for  October 24, 2024.

Bernard Mbunga Mbusu, Alphonce Munyau and Samuel Musembi Kamito were arrested at their respective residents in Syokimau, Kitengela and Kamito in an operation led by the DCI Nairobi Area Crime Research and Intelligence Bureau detectives backed up by their Lang'ata counterparts. 

According to the victim who's a pastor at the Christ Church, he was heading for dinner after a beehive of activities planning for the forthcoming Benny Hinn crusade set to be held at the Nyayo National Stadium, when three men accosted him and bundled him in a waiting saloon car. 

Once in the car, the man of the cloth reported to have been stripped naked and photos of him taken before he was forced to reveal his Mpesa pin lest the photos be uploaded on his social media platforms. Complying under duress, Sh55,000 was transferred to one of the suspect's phone and thereafter he was released.

On 7th March, 2019, the Financial Investigations Unit (FIU) at DCI Headquarters launched investigations touching on allegations of a mega fraud scheme which was reported by the Ministry of Trade and Cooperatives and individual investors who had invested with the above entities. The mentioned entities are owned by  David Kariuki Ngari alias Gakuyo.

The allegations were that close to 70,000 members had invested with the entities to a sum of Sh1.5 billion but their monies had been misappropriated.

Investigations commenced with over 200 sampled statements being recorded from the victims. The Ministry of Industry, Trade & Cooperatives also formed an audit team that found that a total of Sh 1,052,746,094 had been misappropriated by David Kariuki Ngari and other top managers between year 2015 and 2018.

Upon completion of the investigations, the inquiry file was forwarded to the ODPP for perusal and advice. The investigating team recommended offenses of conspiracy to defraud, stealing and obtaining money by false pretenses among other charges. A consent to charge by the ODPP was given on December 8, 2023. 

Later on January 16, 2024, another 12 files on the same matter were forwarded to the ODPP for perusal and advice.
